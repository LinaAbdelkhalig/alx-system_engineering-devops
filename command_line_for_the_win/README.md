Here are the steps I followed to upload the screenshots using SFTP:
1. Copied the SFTP command for my sandbox and pasted it on my local Git Bash along with the password.
2. Navigated to the alx-system_engineering_devops/ using `cd`.
3. Created the directory for the project "command-line-for-the-win" using `mkdir` and navigated to that directory.
4. Navigated to the directory containing the screenshots on my local maching using the command `lcd`.
5. Uploaded each of the screenshots and this readme to the remote environment using the command `put`.
